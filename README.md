# My Digital Workshop: A Claymorphic Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to the source code for my personal corner of the internet. This isn't just a standard portfolio; it's a digital space I've built from the ground up to reflect my journey as a developer and my love for creating unique, tactile web experiences.

Think of it as my personal workshop, where I blend the logic of embedded systems with the art of frontend development. The entire site is wrapped in a "claymorphic" design, giving it a soft, 3D, and friendly feel that I hope makes you want to click around and explore.

## ✨ Core Technologies

This project was brought to life with a modern, lightweight tech stack:

-   **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: For a lightning-fast development experience.
-   **[React](https://react.dev/)**: The heart of the user interface.
-   **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: To keep the code clean, robust, and scalable.
-   **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: For crafting the custom, claymorphic UI with utility classes.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **A Unique "Claymorphic" Design:** A soft, 3D-inspired UI that makes interacting with the site a delight.
-   **Comprehensive Sections:**
    -   **About Me:** A little peek into who I am, my skills, and my journey as a Computer Engineering student.
    -   **Services:** A breakdown of what I can do, from frontend and backend development to embedded systems.
    -   **Work Gallery & Case Studies:** A showcase of my projects, highlighting my skills and problem-solving process.
    -   **Testimonials:** Kind words from people I've worked with.
-   **On-Page Admin Panel:** No need to dig into the code to update content! I've built a simple admin dashboard directly into the site. From here, you can:
    -   Add, edit, or delete projects in the **Work Gallery**.
    -   Manage your **Case Studies**.
    -   Update the **Testimonials** page with new client feedback.
